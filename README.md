# Grip
Whenever you go out with friends for food or other activities, it can be frustrating and time consuming to determine how much each person should pay for their own share. 
Since there is typically one copy of the receipt, it can be hard to remember what you paid for a few weeks later. 
Grip allows you to calculate the total amount that each person should pay and send a copy of the receipt to each person through email.
And if you ever need to access previous receipts through the app, there is a record saved to the cloud!
